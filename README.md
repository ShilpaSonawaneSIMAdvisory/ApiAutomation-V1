#### Description: 
This script uses the metadata and the business test case sheet to run automations
for each test case to check whether they have passed or fail based on the output criteria for each test case.
#### Assumptions:
1. The metadata file has the correct structure and all the required fields.
2. Bearer token exists in the secrets file and is valid.
3. The API endpoints are correct and the actions are supported.
4. A POST(filter) request is always before a PUT reqsouest so that its response can be used to construct the PUT payload.
5. The output function will only use attributes from the response of the last step in the sequence.
